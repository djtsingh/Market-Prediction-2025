Recommended experiment tracking:
- MLflow: easy local server + file-based tracking (included in requirements)
- Weights & Biases: good UI and sweep support (requires account)
- Neptune.ai: flexible and team-friendly

Start simple with MLflow for local experiments. Create `experiments/` to store mlruns and artifacts.
